- fix
  - after game is over and player fails, unrevealed cards should appear before the restart animation
  - cross-platform keys (e.g.: code for '/' is not the same across platforms)
  - standardize font sizes according to some base font-size value in body

- tutorial
  - goal of the game
  - steps on how to play
  - list of keyboard actions

- gameplay
  - after game ends, present button to restart instead of restarting automatically
  - choose random message when player succeeds/fails in revealing a number
  - use some extra colors in the game (create a palette)
  - show some animation if player succeeds
  - shake title characters randomly as the game goes on - shakiness also increases as the time left decreases
  - come up with some score function?

- other
  - make it mobile-friendly
    - auto-adjust width
    - open mobile keyboard or draw virtual keyboard containing only relevant keys
  - include link to source code in the footer
