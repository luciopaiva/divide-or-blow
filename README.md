# Divide or Blow!

Disarm the bomb before it blows your browser up!

Reveal the sequence by making divisions and guessing each of the ten digits. Good guesses give you extra time, but bad
assumptions will make the bomb explode faster.

## How to play

Each letter represents a certain unique digit between 0 and 9. Each division gives you information about the quotient
and remainder. For example:

    A / B = H, remainder E

You can also combine letters to form greater numbers:

    CD / F = BF, remainder A

Whenever you have some guess you want to try, you can type:

    A = 8

And the game you tell you if it was a good guess or not :-)

## Keys

When trying divisions, use keys `A` to `J` to type numbers, `/` to enter the divisor and `⏎` to run the division.

When making guesses, type the letter (`A` to `J`), followed by `=` and then the corresponding digit (`0` to `9`), pressing `⏎` to see the result.
